We are looking for a Go developer who is experienced with the Ethereum blockchain.
Your task is to adapt the scraping mechanism in the CurveFi DEX scraper in our repository such that all data is retrieved directly from the smart contract. The data formats and the scraped quantities should remain the same. In order to connect to the Ethereum blockchain, please use the Infura API.
