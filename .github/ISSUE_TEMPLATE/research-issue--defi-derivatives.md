We are looking for a developer who is experienced in DeFi. Your task is to do research on the protocols in the "derivatives" category of https://defipulse.com/
More precisely, please answer the following questions for all 7 sites on the list:

1. What types of derivatives are available?
2. What types are shared across sites? What are the differences?
3. Referring to item 2.:  What data format(s) can be introduced in order to integrate products (preferably think in golang, like we do)?
4. Is data accessible? If so, how? (for instance through an (websocket) API or thegraph.com)

Please report your findings in a text document in a common format.
